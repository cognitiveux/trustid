										<p>We would like to invite you to participate to the First Proof of Concept Evaluation Study of TRUSTID. TRUSTID stands for “Intelligent and Continuous Online Student Identity Management for Improving Security and Trust in European Higher Education Institutions” and is part of the actions of Erasmus+ 2020 under the Call "Strategic Partnerships in Response to the COVID-19 Situation: Partnerships for Digital Education Readiness in the field of Higher Education (KA226)".</p>
										<p>The studies will be held virtually between <b>15/01/2022 – 20/02/2022 through three (3) short phases</b> as follows:</p>
										<p><b>Phase 1 (15 minutes, end of January 2022, you will be informed through email with further instructions) – Creation of Computational User Identification Models</b></p>
										<p>You will visit the project’s website, which will be sent to you via email where you will follow simple steps that will result in the creation of computational user identification models based on your facial images.</p>
										<p><b>Phase 2 (15 minutes, beginning February 2022, you will be informed through email with further instructions) – Verification and Improvement of the Computational User Identification Models</b></p>
										<p>In this phase you will revisit the project’s website, which will again be sent to you via email where you will follow the same steps as in Phase 1.</p>
										<p><b>Phase 3 (30 minutes, 14/02/2022 – 28/02/2022) – Implementation of the User Study</b></p>
